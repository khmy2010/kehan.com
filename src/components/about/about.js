        <p>I am born and raised in Alor Setar, a small town at Kedah.</p>
        <p>
          I like to explore new opportunities and this drives a lot of my
          life-changing decisions, from being part-timer at Genting, to study at
          university far away from my home town and intern at Ipoh, a top
          tourist destination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Believing in people will grow the most outside of their comfort zone,
          I volunteered at Cambodia for 2 months and definitely it was one of
          the story worth sharing a lifetime.
        </p>
        <p>
          After finishing my internship, I realised there are so many gap
          between what we learnt at the university and what is really happening
          at the world out there. To make my final year project more relevant, I
          took up initiative to enrol on courses in modern web development and
          make my FYP with the skills I learnt from there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I am a fresh graduate looking for new opportunities to grow.
