KUALA LUMPUR (THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - It was a sober press conference on what was seized in raids that were part of the police investigation into 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).

The raids had been conducted on homes connected to former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak and his family.

Just after the chief of the commercial crime investigation department Amar Singh told reporters that jewellery, watches and RM114 million (S$38.4 million) in cash in 26 different currencies had been seized, a singular question rang out: "Any updates on the missing chocolates?"

Datuk Seri Amar had to quickly cover a smile.

This was in reference to a complaint by Datuk Seri Najib that some police personnel had raided the fridge at his home and eaten chocolates during their search and seizure operations on May 19.

At Friday's (May 25) press conference, Mr Amar quickly resumed his professional demeanour, saying that Bukit Aman was still waiting for a police report to be lodged on the "disappearing chocolates".

Since Mr Najib's lawyers had issued a statement alleging that chocolates had gone missing from a fridge at one of the premises following the police search, no one has come forward to give any information on the alleged chocolate theft.

[google.com](www.kehan.com) It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the [najib.com](www.rosmah.com) content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
